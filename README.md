# TsunamiDataDownload
A SJTU PRP project, which can download tsunami caused by earthquake data by a button. <br>

## Version

### V0.1 (2018.5.12)
### V0.2 (Internal Version)
### V0.3 (2018.8.28)
### V1.0beta (plan to be released on mid December)
### V1.0 (plan to be released on 2019.1.1)
Include bug fix, code restruction and a more user-friendly command line interface. So, users are recommanded to wait until then. Moreover, a library is on schedule with a fully written document so that tsunami researcher can tailor their own program easily.

## Install

### Windows

#### 0.Make sure you have installed python3.x(3.6 is recommanded) and pip3 and some necessary library.

#### 3.	Install an important package called basemap

Go to *http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/*.
On the page, press CTRL +F and enter basemap and pyproj for quick positioning.  There are several versions, and you need to choose one of them. 32 and 64 on win refer to the Python version installed, and the Numbers behind cp refer to the Python version.<br>

Download one of them to a file. Next, you need change directory to the file and enter pip install xxx(xxx is the name of .whl you have downloaded)
For example, I download basemap-1.1.0-cp36-cp36m-win32.whl, and I put it in the directory E:\JI\prp\p1. So I need to enter the following things in cmd.
